This vignette outlines the design decisions that have been taken during the development of the tracetheme R package, and provides some of the reasoning, and possible pros and cons of each decision.

This document is primarily intended to be read by those interested in understanding the code within the package and for potential package contributors.

## Scope

The package provides one theme function, named `trace_theme()`, to match the name of the existing theme functions provided out of the box by ggplot2.

## Input/Output/Interoperability

This package should work with plots provided by:

- ggplot2
- ggraph

## Dependencies

The only hard dependency of this package should be ggplot2.

We anticipate using other dependencies during the development of this package, such as the colourspace package. But these development packages don't need to be added to the `DESCRIPTION` file.
